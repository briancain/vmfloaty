```

### Example workflow

Grabbing a token for authenticated pooler requests:

```
floaty token get --user username --url https://vmpooler.example.net/api/v1
```

This command will then ask you to log in. If successful, it will return a token that you can save either in a dotfile or use with other cli commands.

Grabbing vms:

```
floaty get centos-7-x86_64=2 debian-7-x86_64 windows-10=3 --token mytokenstring --url https://vmpooler.example.net/api/v1
```

### vmfloaty dotfile

If you do not wish to continuely specify various config options with the cli, you can have a dotfile in your home directory for some defaults. For example:

#### Basic configuration

```yaml
# file at /Users/me/.vmfloaty.yml
url: 'https://vmpooler.example.net/api/v1'
user: 'brian'
token: 'tokenstring'
```

Now vmfloaty will use those config files if no flag was specified.

#### Configuring multiple services

Most commands allow you to specify a `--service <servicename>` option to allow the use of multiple vmpooler instances. This can be useful when you'd rather not specify a `--url` or `--token` by hand for alternate services.

To configure multiple services, you can set up your `~/.vmfloaty.yml` config file like this:

```yaml
# file at /Users/me/.vmfloaty.yml
user: 'brian'
services:
  main:
    url: 'https://vmpooler.example.net/api/v1'
    token: 'tokenstring'
  alternate:
    url: 'https://vmpooler.example.com/api/v1'
    token: 'alternate-tokenstring'
```

- If you run `floaty` without a `--service <name>` option, vmfloaty will use the first configured service by default.
  With the config file above, the default would be to use the 'main' vmpooler instance.
- If keys are missing for a configured service, vmfloaty will attempt to fall back to the top-level values.
  With the config file above, 'brian' will be used as the username for both configured services, since neither specifies a username.

Examples using the above configuration:

List available vm types from our main vmpooler instance:
```sh
floaty list --service main
# or, since the first configured service is used by default:
floaty list
```

List available vm types from our alternate vmpooler instance:
```sh
floaty list --service alternate
```

#### Using a Nonstandard Pooler service

vmfloaty is capable of working with Puppet's [nonstandard pooler](https://github.com/puppetlabs/nspooler) in addition to the default vmpooler API. To add a nonstandard pooler service, specify an API `type` value in your service configuration, like this:

```yaml
# file at /Users/me/.vmfloaty.yml
user: 'brian'
services:
  vm:
    url: 'https://vmpooler.example.net/api/v1'
    token: 'tokenstring'
  ns:
    url: 'https://nspooler.example.net/api/v1'
    token: 'nspooler-tokenstring'
    type: 'nonstandard'  # <-- 'type' is necessary for any non-vmpooler service
  abs:
    url: 'https://abs.example.net/api/v2'
    token: 'abs-tokenstring'
    type: 'abs'  # <-- 'type' is necessary for any non-vmpooler service
```

With this configuration, you could list available OS types from nspooler like this:

```sh
floaty list --service ns
```

#### Valid config keys

Here are the keys that vmfloaty currently supports:

- verbose
  + Boolean
- token
  + String
- user
  + String
- url
  + String
- services
  + Map

### Tab Completion

There is a basic completion script for Bash (and possibly other shells) included with the gem in the [extras/completions](https://github.com/briancain/vmfloaty/blob/master/extras/completions) folder. To activate, that file simply needs to be sourced somehow in your shell profile.

For convenience, the path to the completion script for the currently active version of the gem can be found with the `floaty completion` subcommand. This makes it easy to add the completion script to your profile like so:

```bash
source $(floaty completion --shell bash)
```

If you are running on macOS and use Homebrew's `bash-completion` formula, you can symlink the script to `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/floaty` and it will be sourced automatically:

```bash
ln -s $(floaty completion --shell bash) /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/floaty
```

## vmpooler API

This cli tool uses the [vmpooler API](https://github.com/puppetlabs/vmpooler/blob/master/API.md).

## Using the Pooler class

vmfloaty providers a `Pooler` class that gives users the ability to make requests to vmpooler without having to write their own requests. It also provides an `Auth` class for managing vmpooler tokens within your application.

### Example Projects

- [John McCabe: vmpooler-bitbar](https://github.com/johnmccabe/vmpooler-bitbar/)
  + vmpooler status and management in your menubar with bitbar
- [Brian Cain: vagrant-vmpooler](https://github.com/briancain/vagrant-vmpooler)
  + Use Vagrant to manage your vmpooler instances
